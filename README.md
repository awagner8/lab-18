# Lab 18

## Overview

This is your first lab getting familiar with concurrency through the use of
posix threads.  

There are three `.c` files, but only one that you have to implement. The first
two, `thread1.c` and `thread2.c`, are for you to compile and run just to see
the thread interface in action and to show the difference between local and
global (shared) state in a multithreaded program.

Your programming task is `thread3.c` where you are to complete the program by
finishing the `thread_double` and `main` routines.  

---

### `pthread` library

In this lab, we will be using some wrapper functions that replace the default
library functions.  You must use use posix thread calls with a capital 'P'
(e.g., `Pthread_create` instead of `pthread_create`).  The arguments are the
same as in the pthread library routines. The autograder requires that you use
the given capital letter functions in order to measure the correctness of the
program. See [mythreads.h](mythreads.h) for function declarations.

### `thread3.c`

`thread_double`: Takes a pointer to an `args_t` structure (cast as a `void*`
per the pthread API) which provides an integer `id` as well as a start and end
index into the global `array`. The function should:

1. First, call the function `print_thread_info()` to print the current process
   and thread ID.

2. Then, call the function `print_args()` to print the input args.
   `print_args()` needs a `arg_t` which means you will have to cast argin to an
   `arg_t` type before passing it to the `print_args()` function.

3. Multiply each entry within its range (start <= index < end) in `array` by 2.
   The start index and end index can be found from `argin` casted to a `arg_t`
   variable and by accessing its fields.

4. Use printf with format `"%ld done\n"` to print the thread's id returned from
   the `Thread_gettid()` function right before returning from the function.

`main`: you need to create 4 threads that each operate on 1/4 of the global
`array`.  You need to allocate and initialize the `arg_t` argument structures
appropriately.  You should assign the child threads ids 0-3 based on which part
of the array they are accessing, where thread 0 has a start index of 0 and
thread 3 has an end index of 1000.

The `main` routine should wait for all four child threads to complete before
continuing to the finish up code provided.

You can run the programs manually on the command line to quickly see their
print outputs. Compare them to the example output below -- the only differences
should be that (1) your program can print different thread `tid` values and (2)
the threads can execute in any order.

### Example output for `thread3`:

```
main: before 499500
pid 12345 tid 56719
args: id 0 start 0 end 250
56719 done
pid 12345 tid 56720
args: id 1 start 250 end 500
56720 done
pid 12345 tid 56721
args: id 2 start 500 end 750
56721 done 
pid 12345 tid 56722
args: id 3 start 750 end 1000
56722 done
main: result 999000
```

### Local Testing and Submission

To run the testing kit, use the following command
```bash
python3 test_kit.py ALL
```
Submit your completed `thread3.c` to Gradescope.
